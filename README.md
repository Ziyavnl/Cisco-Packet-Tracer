# Cisco-Packet-Tracer


## Internet networks and data transmission networks I made with cisco.

* Multiple routers and their connections to each other.
* I created both wireless and wired connections.
* I established a data sharing network where multiple types of connections communicate with each other.
* Connection examples like PAN,LAN,MAN,WAN


* I prepared the DHCP connections and static data transfer connections I made as a test and project.
